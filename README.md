# Portfolio

This is my portfolio site - there are many like it, but this one is mine. It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). There is also a GH Actions deployment workflow and Terraform configuration files for deploying the site to S3 behind CloudFront.

To start a development server:
```
hugo server -D
```

To create a new page:
```
hugo new pagename/_index.md
```
