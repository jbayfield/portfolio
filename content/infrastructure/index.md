Managing IT infrastructure is my day job - in particular I'm a competent Linux Systems Administrator, with excellent problem solving skills and a hunger to learn more.

## Tools of choice
* Debian/Ubuntu Linux (though I will quite happily use RHEL-based distros like CentOS/Fedora too)
* Python for scripting
* Ansible for configuration management and automation

## Other skills
* TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP and related fundamentals
* Git version control (with GitHub/GitLab as companions)
* Proxmox and libvirt/KVM virtualisation suites
* Datacentre hardware installation and maintenance
* Configuring network switches (Arista, Netgear, Cisco in particular)
* Web server configuration (LAMP/LEMP)
* Email stacks (Dovecot, exim4 in particular) and related deliverability issues (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
* Atlassian stack administration (Jira/Confluence Data Center)
* AWS services (IAM, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, etc.)
* Working in service-oriented environments, managing and prioritising customer requests
* Knows how to quit vim ;)

## Things I'm learning more about
* Terraform for IaC
* Prometheus/Grafana for observability
