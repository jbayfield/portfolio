![Projects](/img/projects.jpg)

I undertake a vast array of projects, though like most people only a subset of them ever reach completion or materialise into something useful for the wider world. For an up to date list of my IT-aligned projects I suggest looking at my [GitHub](https://github.com/jbayfield).

I enjoy tinkering with electronics, and am a licensed radio amateur. High-Altitude Ballooning (HAB) is an interest of mine and I try to participate in [tracking balloons and receiving imagery](https://ukhas.org.uk/guides:tracking_guide) from onboard cameras as they fly. I don't currently have any projects on the interwebz on these subjects but it's something I hope to expand upon soon.
