# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a human sitting on top of a very big rock floating in space - most people call me **Josh**.

ðŸ“º In my day job I work as a systems engineer at the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/), where I look after DevOps and Workflow applications.

ðŸ”§ When I'm not doing that, I'm developing my skills in automation and software engineering. You can find out more about my technical skills [here](/infrastructure).

ðŸŽ­ I also spend a lot of my spare time working as a freelance theatre technician, which you can read more about [here](/theatre).

ðŸ“± You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbayfield) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshuabayfield).
