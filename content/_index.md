# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a human sitting on top of a very big rock floating in space - most people call me **Josh**.

ðŸ¦„ In my day job I work as a systems administrator at [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/), where I'm part of a small team working to provide hosting and colocation services that _just work_.

ðŸ”§ When I'm not taming mythical creatures, I'm developing my skills in automation and software engineering. You can find out more about my technical skills [here](/infrastructure).

ðŸŽ­ I also spend a lot of my spare time working as an amateur sound designer and theatre technician, which you can read more about [here](/theatre).

ðŸ“± You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbayfield) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshuabayfield).
